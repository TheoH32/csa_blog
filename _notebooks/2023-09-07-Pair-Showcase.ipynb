    "Your HTML and JavaScript code appear to be generally well-structured and functional for the intended purpose. However, I've identified some areas where you can improve the code for readability, maintainability, and security. I'll provide a code review with suggestions for improvement:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Separate JavaScript:** It's a good practice to separate your JavaScript code into an external file rather than including it directly in the HTML. This makes your code easier to manage and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Comments:** While you have some comments in your code, adding more comments, especially for complex functions or sections, will improve code readability and make it easier for others (or your future self) to understand your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Global Variables:** Avoid using global variables whenever possible. For example, you can pass data between functions as parameters or use closures to encapsulate variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Secure Token Handling:** Storing your GitHub token directly in your JavaScript code is not secure. Consider using a more secure method for storing and handling sensitive information, such as environment variables on the server-side.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling in your fetch requests. Display user-friendly error messages when something goes wrong, and log detailed error messages in the console for debugging purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Consistency in Element IDs and Classes:** Ensure consistency in naming conventions for IDs and classes to make your code more organized and easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Validation:** Implement input validation to handle edge cases gracefully. For example, ensure that the GitHub username input is not empty before making the API request.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Use Fetch API:** You're using both XMLHttpRequest and the Fetch API in your code. It's recommended to stick with one method, and the Fetch API is the more modern and widely used approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **HTML Structure:** Consider organizing your HTML elements logically, such as grouping form elements together and structuring your table for better semantics.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Responsive Design:** Make sure your application is responsive to different screen sizes. Test how it looks and behaves on various devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Separation of Concerns:** Consider using a JavaScript framework or library like React or Vue.js to separate concerns and create a more modular code structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Consistent Indentation:** Ensure consistent indentation throughout your code for better readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **Avoid Inline Event Handlers:** Instead of using inline event handlers like `onclick`, consider attaching event listeners programmatically. This separates HTML and JavaScript and makes it easier to maintain and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **Use ES6 Features:** Consider using ES6 features like arrow functions and template literals to make your code more concise and readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **Security Considerations:** Be cautious about potential security vulnerabilities, especially when dealing with user inputs. Sanitize and validate user input to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or other security issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. **Testing:** Test your application thoroughly to ensure it works as expected in various scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a revised structure for your code with some of these improvements:\n",
    "\n",
    "**HTML (index.html):**\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<!DOCTYPE html>\n",
    "<html>\n",
    "<head>\n",
    "    <!-- Include necessary CSS and external JavaScript files -->\n",
    "    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\">\n",
    "</head>\n",
    "<body>\n",
    "    <!-- Your HTML content here -->\n",
    "\n",
    "    <script src=\"script.js\"></script>\n",
    "</body>\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**JavaScript (script.js):**\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// Define your JavaScript code here\n",
    "\n",
    "// Use modern JavaScript features, like querySelector, addEventListener, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "// Implement your fetch requests using the Fetch API.\n",
    "\n",
    "// Handle user input validation, errors, and display.\n",
    "\n",
    "// Separate concerns into functions/modules for better organization.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these suggestions and continuously refining your code, you can create a more maintainable and secure web application."
